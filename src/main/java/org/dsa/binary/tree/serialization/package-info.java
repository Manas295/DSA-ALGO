/*

erializing and deserializing a binary tree is about converting a tree structure to a string (serialization) and reconstructing the tree from that string (deserialization). This can be really useful for saving the tree to a file or transmitting it over a network.
Serialization
We can perform a pre-order traversal and represent null nodes with a special character, like #.
Deserialization
We can read the string and reconstruct the tree using a queue to handle the order of nodes.
Example in Java
Serialization
java
Copy
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

    public static String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        serializeHelper(root, sb);
        return sb.toString();
    }

    private static void serializeHelper(TreeNode root, StringBuilder sb) {
        if (root == null) {
            sb.append("#,");
            return;
        }
        sb.append(root.val).append(",");
        serializeHelper(root.left, sb);
        serializeHelper(root.right, sb);
    }
}
Deserialization
java
Copy
public class TreeNode {
    //... (existing code)

    public static TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        Queue<String> nodes = new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList(data.split(",")));
        return deserializeHelper(nodes);
    }

    private static TreeNode deserializeHelper(Queue<String> nodes) {
        String val = nodes.poll();
        if ("#".equals(val)) {
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(val));
        node.left = deserializeHelper(nodes);
        node.right = deserializeHelper(nodes);
        return node;
    }
}
Explanation
•	Serialization: serializeHelper recursively traverses the tree, appending values or # for null nodes.
•	Deserialization: deserializeHelper reads from a queue, reconstructing the tree based on the serialized format.
With this approach, you can effectively serialize and deserialize a binary tree. Curious about anything else?12

Copilot
Got it! Let's break it down step-by-step with a more visual approach to understand how the serialization and deserialization of a binary tree work.
1. Example Tree
Consider the following binary tree:
Copy
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   / \
4   5   6
2. Serialization
Serialization is converting the tree into a string representation. Let's walk through the steps:
•	Step 1: Start at the root (1). The serialized string becomes: 1,
•	Step 2: Move to the left child (2). The string becomes: 1,2,
•	Step 3: Move to the left child of 2 (4). The string becomes: 1,2,4,
•	Step 4: 4 has no children, so add # for nulls: 1,2,4,#,#,
•	Step 5: Move back to 2, add # for right null: 1,2,4,#,#,#,
•	Step 6: Move to the right child of 1 (3). The string becomes: 1,2,4,#,#,#,3,
•	Step 7: Move to the left child of 3 (5). The string becomes: 1,2,4,#,#,#,3,5,
•	Step 8: 5 has no children, so add # for nulls: 1,2,4,#,#,#,3,5,#,#,
•	Step 9: Move to the right child of 3 (6). The string becomes: 1,2,4,#,#,#,3,5,#,#,6,
•	Step 10: 6 has no children, so add # for nulls: 1,2,4,#,#,#,3,5,#,#,6,#,#,
So, the final serialized string is: 1,2,4,#,#,#,3,5,#,#,6,#,#,

3. Deserialization
Deserialization is reconstructing the tree from the string representation. Let's walk through the steps:
•	Step 1: Start with the first value (1) as the root.
•	Step 2: The next value (2) becomes the left child of 1.
•	Step 3: The next value (4) becomes the left child of 2.
•	Step 4: The next two # mean 4 has no children.
•	Step 5: Back to 2, the next # means no right child for 2.
•	Step 6: The next value (3) becomes the right child of 1.
•	Step 7: The next value (5) becomes the left child of 3.
•	Step 8: The next two # mean 5 has no children.
•	Step 9: The next value (6) becomes the right child of 3.
•	Step 10: The next two # mean 6 has no children.
This recreates the original tree structure.

Final Visual Representation:

Serialized: 1,2,4,#,#,#,3,5,#,#,6,#,#,
Deserialized:
Copy
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   / \
4   5   6
I hope this helps visualize the process better! If you have any further questions, feel free to ask.
